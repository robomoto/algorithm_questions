def max_stack():
    """
    Implements a stack that supports push, pop, top, peekMax, and popMax operations.

    The stack should support retrieving and removing the maximum element efficiently.

    Methods:
        push(x: int) -> None:
            Pushes an integer onto the stack.

        pop() -> int:
            Removes and returns the top element of the stack.

        top() -> int:
            Returns the top element without removing it.

        peekMax() -> int:
            Returns the maximum element in the stack without removing it.

        popMax() -> int:
            Retrieves and removes the maximum element in the stack. If there is more than one maximum,
            only the top-most one is removed.

    Args:
        x (int): The value to be pushed onto the stack.

    Returns:
        int: The result for pop, top, peekMax, and popMax operations.
        None: For the push operation.
