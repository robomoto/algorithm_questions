    """
    Determines if a path exists between two nodes in a graph.

    Given a graph represented as an adjacency list and two nodes, the task is to determine if there exists a path 
    from one node to the other. The graph is undirected, and the path can travel along any of the edges connecting 
    the nodes.

    Args:
        graph (List[List[int]]): An adjacency list representing the graph.
        start (int): The starting node.
        end (int): The destination node.

    Returns:
        bool: True if a path exists between the start and end nodes, False otherwise.
