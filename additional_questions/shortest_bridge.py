def shortest_bridge():
    """
    Finds the shortest bridge between two islands in a grid.

    Given a 2D grid representing two islands (1s) separated by water (0s), the task is to find the length of the 
    shortest bridge that connects the two islands. A bridge is formed by turning 0s into 1s to connect the two islands.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the shortest bridge between the two islands.
