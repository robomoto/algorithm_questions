    Designs an in-memory file system.

    Given a set of file operations, the task is to implement a simple in-memory file system that can handle file creation,
    reading, and directory structure management. The file system should store files and directories in memory and support
    operations like creating directories, adding files, and retrieving file contents.

    Args:
        path (str): A string representing the file or directory path.
        content (str, optional): The content of the file to be created. Default is None.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the operation is successful, False otherwise.
