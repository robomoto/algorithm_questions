def implement_queue_using_stacks():
    """
    Implements a queue using two stacks.

    The task is to implement a queue data structure using two stacks. The queue should support the following operations:
    - `push(x)`: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
    - `pop()`: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
    - `peek()`: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
    - `empty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.

    Args:
        x (int): The element to be added to the queue in the `push` method.

    Returns:
        int: The element removed from the front of the queue in the `pop` method, or the front element in `peek`.
        bool: The result of checking if the queue is empty in `empty`.
