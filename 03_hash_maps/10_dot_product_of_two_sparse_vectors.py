def dot_product_of_two_sparse_vectors():
    """
    Computes the dot product of two sparse vectors.

    The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements. In this case,
    the vectors are sparse, meaning most of their elements are zero. The task is to efficiently compute the dot
    product by only considering the non-zero elements.

    Args:
        v1 (List[int]): The first sparse vector.
        v2 (List[int]): The second sparse vector.

    Returns:
        int: The dot product of the two vectors.
