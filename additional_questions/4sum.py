def four_sum():
    """
    Finds all unique quadruplets in an array that sum up to a target value.

    Given an array of integers and a target value, the task is to find all unique quadruplets in the array whose sum 
    is equal to the target. Each quadruplet must consist of four distinct integers from the array, and the result 
    should not contain duplicate quadruplets.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers to find the quadruplets from.
        target (int): The target sum for the quadruplets.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of lists where each inner list represents a unique quadruplet whose sum is equal to the target.
