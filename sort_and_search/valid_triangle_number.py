    Determines the number of valid triangles that can be formed from a list of numbers.

    Given a list of integers, the task is to determine how many unique triplets can form a valid triangle.
    A valid triangle is one where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers representing the lengths of the sides.

    Returns:
        int: The number of valid triangles that can be formed.
