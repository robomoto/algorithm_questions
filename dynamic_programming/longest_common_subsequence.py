def longest_common_subsequence():
    """
    Finds the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings.

    A subsequence is derived by deleting some or no characters from the string without changing the order
    of the remaining characters. The goal is to find the longest subsequence that is common between the two strings.

    Args:
        text1 (str): The first string.
        text2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest common subsequence between the two strings.
