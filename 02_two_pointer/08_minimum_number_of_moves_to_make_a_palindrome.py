    Finds the minimum number of moves to make a string palindrome.

    Given a string, the task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to make the string a palindrome. 
    A move is defined as swapping two characters in the string.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be transformed into a palindrome.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of swaps required to make the string a palindrome, or -1 if it's impossible.
