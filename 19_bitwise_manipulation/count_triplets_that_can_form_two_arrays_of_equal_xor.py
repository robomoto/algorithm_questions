    Counts the number of triplets (i, j, k) in the array such that the XOR of elements
    from index i to j - 1 is equal to the XOR of elements from index j to k.

    The indices must satisfy the condition: 0 <= i < j <= k < len(arr).

        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The number of triplets satisfying the XOR equality condition.
