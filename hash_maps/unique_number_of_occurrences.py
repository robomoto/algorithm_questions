    Determines if the number of occurrences of each element in a list is unique.

    Given a list of integers, the task is to determine if the frequency of each number is unique. 
    In other words, no two elements in the list should have the same frequency.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements in the list have unique frequencies, False otherwise.
