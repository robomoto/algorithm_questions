    Splits a circular linked list into two halves.

    Given a circular linked list, the task is to split the list into two halves. If the number of nodes is odd,
    the first half should have one more node than the second half. Both halves should still form valid circular linked lists.

    Args:
        head (ListNode): The head node of the circular linked list.

    Returns:
        Tuple[ListNode, ListNode]: A tuple containing the heads of the two new circular linked lists.
