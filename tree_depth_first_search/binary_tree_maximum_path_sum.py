def binary_tree_maximum_path_sum():
    """
    Finds the maximum path sum in a binary tree.

    Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the maximum path sum. A path is defined as a sequence of nodes 
    where each node is connected to the next node by an edge, and the sum of the nodes in the path is the sum of their values.
    The path can start and end at any node in the tree, but the path must follow the treeâ€™s edges.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum path sum in the binary tree.
