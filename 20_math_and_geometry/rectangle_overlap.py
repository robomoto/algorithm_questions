def rectangle_overlap():
    """
    Determines if two rectangles overlap.

    Given two rectangles, each represented by the coordinates of their bottom-left and top-right corners, 
    the task is to determine if the two rectangles overlap. The rectangles are represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] 
    and [x3, y3, x4, y4], where (x1, y1) and (x3, y3) are the bottom-left corners, and (x2, y2) and (x4, y4) are 
    the top-right corners.

    Args:
        rec1 (List[int]): The coordinates of the first rectangle as [x1, y1, x2, y2].
        rec2 (List[int]): The coordinates of the second rectangle as [x3, y3, x4, y4].

    Returns:
        bool: True if the rectangles overlap, False otherwise.
