def lru_cache():
    """
    Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

    The LRU cache supports the following operations in O(1) time:
      - get(key): Retrieves the value associated with the key if it exists in the cache, otherwise returns -1.
      - put(key, value): Inserts or updates the value of the key. When the cache reaches its capacity,
        it evicts the least recently used item before inserting a new one.

    Methods:
        get(key: int) -> int
        put(key: int, value: int) -> None

    Args:
        key (int): The key to retrieve or insert.
        value (int): The value to associate with the key during insertion.

    Returns:
        int: The value associated with the key for get operation, or -1 if not found.
        None: For the put operation.
