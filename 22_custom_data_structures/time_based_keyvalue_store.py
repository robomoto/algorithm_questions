def time_based_keyvalue_store():
    """
    Implements a time-based key-value store.

    This data structure supports storing multiple values for the same key at different timestamps
    and retrieving the value with the largest timestamp less than or equal to a given timestamp.

    Methods:
        set(key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
            Stores the key with the given value and timestamp.

        get(key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
            Retrieves the value associated with the key at the given timestamp,
            or the value with the closest earlier timestamp if an exact match is not found.

    Args:
        key (str): The key to set or retrieve.
        value (str): The value to store for the key.
        timestamp (int): The time at which the value is stored or queried.

    Returns:
        str: The value associated with the key at the specified or nearest earlier timestamp.
        None: For the set operation.
