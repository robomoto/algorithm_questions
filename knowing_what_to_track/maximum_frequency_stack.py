def maximum_frequency_stack():
    """
    Implements a stack that supports push, pop, and retrieving the element with the maximum frequency.

    The stack supports the following operations:
      - push(val): Adds an element to the stack.
      - pop(): Removes and returns the most recent element from the stack.
      - top(): Returns the most recent element without removing it.
      - peekMax(): Returns the element with the highest frequency in the stack.
      - popMax(): Removes and returns the element with the highest frequency in the stack.

    Methods:
        push(val: int) -> None:
            Adds the element to the stack.

        pop() -> int:
            Removes and returns the most recent element.

        top() -> int:
            Returns the most recent element without removing it.

        peekMax() -> int:
            Returns the element with the highest frequency.

        popMax() -> int:
            Removes and returns the element with the highest frequency.

    Args:
        val (int): The element to add or remove from the stack.

    Returns:
        int: The element popped or peeking from the stack.
        None: For the push operation.
