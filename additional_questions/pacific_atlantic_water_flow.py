def pacific_atlantic_water_flow():
    """
    Finds the cells in a matrix that can reach both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

    Given a 2D matrix representing the heights of cells in a grid, the task is to find all cells where water can flow 
    to both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Water can flow from a cell to its neighboring cell if the neighboring cell 
    has an equal or lower height, and it can flow to the Pacific Ocean if it reaches the top or left edge, and to the 
    Atlantic Ocean if it reaches the bottom or right edge.

    Args:
        matrix (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid where each cell contains an integer representing its height.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[int, int]]: A list of coordinates representing the cells from which water can flow to both oceans.
