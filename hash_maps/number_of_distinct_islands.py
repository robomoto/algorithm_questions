    Counts the number of distinct islands in a 2D grid.

    An island is a group of 1s connected horizontally or vertically. The task is to find the number of distinct 
    islands in the grid. Two islands are considered distinct if they have different shapes or sizes.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the grid, where 1s represent land and 0s represent water.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct islands in the grid.
