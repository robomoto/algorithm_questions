def network_delay_time():
    """
    Determines the time it will take for all nodes to receive a signal in a network.

    The network is represented as a directed graph where each edge has a travel time. The task is to find the time
    it takes for all nodes to receive a signal from a given starting node. If some nodes cannot receive the signal,
    the function should return -1.

    Args:
        times (List[List[int]]): A list of edges where each edge is a list of three integers [u, v, w],
                                  representing a directed edge from node u to node v with a travel time of w.
        N (int): The total number of nodes in the network.
        K (int): The starting node for the signal.

    Returns:
        int: The time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal, or -1 if not all nodes can receive the signal.
