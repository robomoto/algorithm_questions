def interval_list_intersections():
    """
    Finds the intersection of two lists of intervals.

    Given two lists of intervals, the task is to find the intervals that intersect between the two lists.
    Each list is sorted by the start time, and the intersection of two intervals is defined as the range where they overlap.

    Args:
        A (List[Tuple[int, int]]): The first list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a tuple of start and end times.
        B (List[Tuple[int, int]]): The second list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a tuple of start and end times.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[int, int]]: A list of intervals representing the intersection between the two lists.
