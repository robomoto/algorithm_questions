def minimum_space_wasted_from_packaging():
    """
    Calculates the minimum space wasted from packaging.

    Given a list of box sizes and a list of items to be packed, the task is to find the minimum space wasted when 
    packing all items into the boxes. The box sizes are fixed, and each item must be packed into a box that is at least 
    as large as the item. The space wasted is the difference between the box size and the item size.

    Args:
        boxes (List[int]): A list of integers representing the sizes of the available boxes.
        items (List[int]): A list of integers representing the sizes of the items to be packed.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum total space wasted from packing all items into the boxes.
