def course_schedule():
    """
    Determines if it is possible to finish all courses.

    Given a list of courses and their prerequisites, the task is to determine if it is possible to finish all courses 
    by following the prerequisite relationships. Each course has a list of other courses it depends on, and the task 
    is to determine if there are any cycles in the prerequisite graph that would make it impossible to complete all the courses.

    Args:
        numCourses (int): The total number of courses.
        prerequisites (List[List[int]]): A list of prerequisite pairs, where each pair [a, b] indicates that 
                                         course `a` has `b` as a prerequisite.

    Returns:
        bool: True if it is possible to finish all the courses, False otherwise.
