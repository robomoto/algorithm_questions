    Checks if a binary tree is symmetric.

    Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to determine if the tree is symmetric around its center. 
    A tree is symmetric if its left and right subtrees are mirror images of each other.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the tree is symmetric, False otherwise.
