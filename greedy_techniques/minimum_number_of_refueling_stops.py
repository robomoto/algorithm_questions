    Determines the minimum number of refueling stops required to reach the destination.

    You are given a starting fuel amount, a target destination, and a list of available gas stations with their
    respective distances and fuel capacities. The task is to determine the minimum number of refueling stops
    needed to reach the target destination.

    Args:
        target (int): The target destination distance.
        startFuel (int): The initial fuel amount.
        stations (List[List[int]]): A list of gas stations, where each station is represented as [distance, fuel].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of refueling stops required to reach the target, or -1 if it's impossible to reach the destination.
