def largest_number_after_digit_swaps_by_parity():
    """
    Finds the largest number that can be obtained by swapping digits based on their parity (even or odd).

    Given a number, the task is to rearrange its digits such that the even digits are swapped with each other 
    and the odd digits are swapped with each other to form the largest possible number. 
    The relative order of digits within each parity group should remain the same.

    Args:
        num (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The largest number that can be formed by swapping digits based on parity.
