def regions_cut_by_slashes():
    """
    Finds the number of regions formed by cutting a grid with slashes.

    Given a grid representing a map where each cell is either a '/', '\', or ' ', the task is to determine the
    number of distinct regions formed when cutting the grid with slashes. The grid may contain slashes forming 
    diagonal walls, and the regions are formed by spaces enclosed by the slashes.

    Args:
        grid (List[str]): A list of strings representing the grid, where each string is a row in the grid.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct regions formed by the slashes in the grid.
