    Determines if a linked list is a palindrome.

    A linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of values from the head to the tail is the same
    as the sequence from the tail to the head. The task is to check if the linked list reads the same
    forward and backward.

    Args:
        head (ListNode): The head node of the linked list.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the linked list is a palindrome, False otherwise.
