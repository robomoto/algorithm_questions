def lfu_cache():
    """
    Implements a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.

    The LFU cache should support the following operations in O(1) or O(log n) time:
      - get(key): Retrieves the value of the key if it exists in the cache, otherwise returns -1.
      - put(key, value): Updates the value of the key if present; otherwise, adds the key-value pair to the cache.
        If the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used key.
        If there is a tie, the least recently used key is removed.

    Methods:
        get(key: int) -> int
        put(key: int, value: int) -> None

    Args:
        key (int): The key to retrieve or insert.
        value (int): The value to associate with the key during insertion.

    Returns:
        int: The value associated with the key for get operation, or -1 if not present.
        None: For the put operation.
