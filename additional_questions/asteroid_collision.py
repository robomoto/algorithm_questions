def asteroid_collision():
    """
    Simulates asteroid collisions in space.

    Given a list of integers representing asteroids, where positive numbers represent asteroids moving right 
    and negative numbers represent asteroids moving left, the task is to simulate the collisions between asteroids.
    If two asteroids collide, the larger asteroid survives. If the asteroids have the same size, both are destroyed. 
    The goal is to return the final state of the asteroids after all collisions.

    Args:
        asteroids (List[int]): A list of integers representing the asteroids and their directions.

    Returns:
        List[int]: The final state of the asteroids after all collisions.
