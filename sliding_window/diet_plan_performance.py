def diet_plan_performance():
    """
    Calculates the performance of a diet plan based on the calories consumed.

    Given a list of calories burned each day and a set of performance criteria, the task is to calculate the 
    total performance of a diet plan. The performance is calculated by summing the calories burned for days 
    that meet certain conditions, such as being over a specific target or achieving a streak.

    Args:
        calories (List[int]): A list representing the number of calories burned each day.
        k (int): A specific target number of calories for evaluating performance.
        lower (int): The lower bound for the calories to be considered for performance.
        upper (int): The upper bound for the calories to be considered for performance.

    Returns:
        int: The total performance value of the diet plan.
