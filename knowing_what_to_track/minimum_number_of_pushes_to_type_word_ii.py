    Calculates the minimum number of key presses required to type a word on a typewriter.

    Given a list of key presses and a target word, the task is to find the minimum number of key presses
    required to type the entire word. Each key press in the typewriter can be repeated multiple times, and 
    consecutive keys are allowed to be typed without moving to a different key.

    Args:
        word (str): The target word to be typed.
        keypresses (List[str]): A list representing the key presses available for typing the word.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of key presses required to type the entire word.
