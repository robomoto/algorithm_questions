def height_of_binary_tree_after_subtree_removal_queries():
    """
    Finds the height of a binary tree after subtree removal queries.

    Given a binary tree, the task is to find the height of the tree after removing certain subtrees based on a series of queries. 
    Each query specifies a node to remove and asks for the height of the tree after the removal of the subtree rooted at that node.
    The height of the tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to any leaf.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.
        queries (List[int]): A list of nodes to be removed, each represented by the value of the node.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers where each integer is the height of the tree after the corresponding subtree removal query.
