def solution_compilation_order():
    """
    Determines the solution compilation order based on dependencies.

    Given a list of solutions and their dependencies, the task is to determine the order in which the solutions
    should be compiled. Each solution has a list of other solutions it depends on, and the order should ensure that
    each solution is compiled only after its dependencies are compiled.

    Args:
        solutions (List[str]): A list of solution names.
        dependencies (List[Tuple[str, str]]): A list of dependency pairs, where each pair [a, b] indicates that
                                              solution `a` depends on solution `b`.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of solutions in the correct compilation order, or an empty list if a valid order does not exist.
