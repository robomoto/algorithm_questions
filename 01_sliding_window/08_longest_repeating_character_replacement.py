def longest_repeating_character_replacement():
    """
    Finds the length of the longest substring with at most k character replacements.

    Given a string and an integer k, the task is to find the length of the longest substring that can be obtained by
    replacing at most k characters in the string. The goal is to make the substring as long as possible while keeping 
    all characters the same after the replacements.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.
        k (int): The maximum number of character replacements allowed.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest substring that can be formed.
