    Counts the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of a number.

    Given an integer, the task is to count how many bits in its binary representation are '1'. This is also known as 
    the Hamming weight or population count of the number.

    Args:
        n (int): The input integer.

        int: The number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the input number.
