def find_the_town_judge():
    """
    Finds the town judge in a town represented by a graph of trust relationships.

    In a town, the judge is the person who is trusted by everyone else, but trusts no one themselves. 
    Given a list of trust relationships, the task is to determine who the town judge is, or return -1 if no such person exists.

    Args:
        N (int): The number of people in the town.
        trust (List[List[int]]): A list of trust relationships, where each pair [a, b] indicates that person `a` trusts person `b`.

    Returns:
        int: The label of the town judge, or -1 if no such judge exists.
