    Finds the maximum depth of a binary tree.

    Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to determine the maximum depth of the tree. The maximum depth is
    defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the farthest leaf node.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum depth of the binary tree.
