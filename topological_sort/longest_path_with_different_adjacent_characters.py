    Finds the longest path in a tree where no two adjacent characters are the same.

    Given a tree represented by nodes, where each node contains a character, the task is to find the longest path
    that can be formed such that no two adjacent nodes have the same character. The path can travel from the root to any leaf node.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the tree, where each node has a character and child nodes.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest path with different adjacent characters.
