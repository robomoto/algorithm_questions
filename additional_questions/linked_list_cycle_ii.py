def linked_list_cycle_ii():
    """
    Detects the starting node of the cycle in a linked list.

    Given the head of a linked list, the task is to detect if the linked list has a cycle and, if it does,
    return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return None. The linked list may contain a 
    cycle in which a node's next pointer points back to a previous node, forming a loop.

    Args:
        head (ListNode): The head node of the linked list.

    Returns:
        ListNode: The node where the cycle begins, or None if there is no cycle.
