    """
    Serializes and deserializes a binary tree.

    The task is to implement methods to serialize a binary tree into a string and deserialize a string back into a binary tree.
    Serialization is the process of converting a binary tree into a string format for easy storage or transmission, 
    while deserialization converts the string back into the original binary tree structure.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree to be serialized or deserialized.
    
    Returns:
        str: The serialized string representation of the binary tree.
        TreeNode: The root node of the deserialized binary tree.
