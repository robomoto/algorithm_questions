def compilation_order():
    """
    Determines the order of compilation based on dependencies.

    Given a list of tasks and their dependencies, the task is to find the order in which the tasks should be compiled.
    Each task has a list of other tasks it depends on, and the order should ensure that each task is compiled only after
    all of its dependencies have been compiled.

    Args:
        tasks (List[str]): A list of tasks.
        dependencies (List[Tuple[str, str]]): A list of dependency pairs, where each pair represents a dependency 
                                              between two tasks, with the second task depending on the first.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of tasks in the correct compilation order, or an empty list if a valid order does not exist.
