def where_will_the_ball_fall():
    """
    Determines the final position of a ball dropped through a grid.

    Given a grid where each cell is either a 'V' (representing a left-facing slope) or a '>' (representing a right-facing slope),
    the task is to determine the final position of a ball dropped from the top row. The ball will move through the grid and
    bounce off slopes, and the goal is to find the column where the ball will fall to the bottom. If the ball gets stuck,
    return -1.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the grid of slopes, where 'V' and '>' represent the slopes.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers representing the final column where each ball will fall, or -1 if the ball gets stuck.
