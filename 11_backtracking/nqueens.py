    """
    Solves the N-Queens problem and returns all distinct solutions.

    The N-Queens problem is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens
    threaten each other. This means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of queens and the size of the chessboard.

    Returns:
        List[List[str]]: A list of solutions, where each solution is represented as a list of
        strings showing the board configuration. Each 'Q' represents a queen and '.' an empty space.
