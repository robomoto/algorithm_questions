def magnetic_force_between_two_balls():
    """
    Calculates the magnetic force between two balls placed on a line.

    Given an array representing the positions of balls on a line and an integer `m` representing the minimum 
    distance between the two balls, the task is to find the maximum magnetic force that can be exerted between 
    any two balls. The force is determined by the distance between the balls, and the force should be maximized.

    Args:
        positions (List[int]): A list of integers representing the positions of the balls on a line.
        m (int): The minimum distance between the two balls.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum magnetic force between two balls.
