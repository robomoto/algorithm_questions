    Removes intervals that are covered by other intervals.

    Given a list of intervals, the task is to remove intervals that are completely covered by other intervals. 
    An interval [a, b] is covered by another interval [c, d] if c <= a and b <= d. The function should return 
    the number of intervals that are not covered by any other interval.

    Args:
        intervals (List[List[int]]): A list of intervals, where each interval is represented by a pair [start, end].

    Returns:
        int: The number of intervals that are not covered by any other interval.
