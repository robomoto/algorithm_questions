def kth_smallest_prime_fraction():
    """
    Finds the k-th smallest prime fraction from a list of primes.

    Given a list of prime numbers, the task is to find the k-th smallest fraction that can be formed by dividing
    any two primes from the list. The fractions should be ordered in ascending order, and you need to return 
    the k-th smallest fraction.

    Args:
        primes (List[int]): A list of prime numbers.
        k (int): The index of the smallest fraction to find (1-based index).

    Returns:
        List[int]: The numerator and denominator of the k-th smallest prime fraction.
