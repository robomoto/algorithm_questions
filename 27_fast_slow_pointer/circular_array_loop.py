def circular_array_loop():
    """
    Determines if there is a cycle in a circular array of integers.

    The array is circular, meaning the last element connects to the first element. The task is to check
    if there exists a loop where you can move through the array by following the direction of the numbers.

    A valid loop must involve moving in the same direction (all positive or all negative) and must
    revisit a previously visited index to form a cycle.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there is a cycle in the array, False otherwise.
