    """
    Flips columns in a matrix to maximize the number of equal rows.

    Given a matrix, the task is to find the maximum number of rows that can be made identical by flipping 
    some of the columns. A column flip means reversing the values in that column (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).

    Args:
        matrix (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the matrix of 0s and 1s.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of identical rows that can be obtained by flipping some columns.
