def build_binary_tree_from_preorder_and_inorder_traversal():
    """
    Builds a binary tree from preorder and inorder traversal.

    Given the preorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree, the task is to reconstruct the binary tree. 
    The preorder traversal provides the root node first, followed by the left and right subtrees. The inorder 
    traversal gives the nodes in the left subtree, followed by the root node, and then the nodes in the right subtree.

    Args:
        preorder (List[int]): A list representing the preorder traversal of the binary tree.
        inorder (List[int]): A list representing the inorder traversal of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        TreeNode: The root node of the reconstructed binary tree.
