def graph_valid_tree():
    """
    Determines if a given graph forms a valid tree.

    A valid tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles. The graph is represented by
    a list of edges, where each edge connects two nodes. The task is to verify if the graph forms a valid tree.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of nodes in the graph.
        edges (List[List[int]]): A list of edges, where each edge is a pair of integers representing an undirected edge.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the graph is a valid tree, False otherwise.
