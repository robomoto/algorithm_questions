def course_schedule_ii():
    """
    Determines the order in which courses should be taken.

    Given a list of courses and their prerequisite relationships, the task is to determine the order in which the courses
    should be taken to complete all of them. Each course has a prerequisite, and the order should ensure that each course is 
    taken only after its prerequisite course.

    Args:
        numCourses (int): The total number of courses.
        prerequisites (List[List[int]]): A list of prerequisite pairs, where each pair [a, b] indicates that 
                                         course `a` has `b` as a prerequisite.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of course indices in the correct order of completion, or an empty list if it is impossible 
                   to finish all the courses.
