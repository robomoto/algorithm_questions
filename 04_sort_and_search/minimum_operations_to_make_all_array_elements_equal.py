    Finds the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal.

    Given an array of integers, the task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all 
    elements in the array equal. In each operation, you can either increment or decrement an element by 1.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal.
