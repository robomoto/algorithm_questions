def min_stack():
    """
    Implements a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

    The stack maintains the current minimum at each level so that getMin can return the
    minimum element in O(1) time.

    Methods:
        push(val: int) -> None:
            Pushes an element onto the stack.

        pop() -> None:
            Removes the top element from the stack.

        top() -> int:
            Returns the top element without removing it.

        getMin() -> int:
            Retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

    Args:
        val (int): The value to be pushed onto the stack.

    Returns:
        int: For top and getMin operations.
        None: For push and pop operations.
