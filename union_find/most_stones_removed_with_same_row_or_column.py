    Finds the maximum number of stones that can be removed in one move.

    Given a 2D grid where each cell either contains a stone or is empty, the task is to remove the maximum number of stones
    that can be removed in one move. A move consists of removing all stones from a row or a column, and the task is to 
    calculate the maximum number of stones that can be removed by removing all stones from any row or column.

    Args:
        stones (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the grid, where 1 represents a stone and 0 represents an empty cell.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of stones that can be removed in one move.
