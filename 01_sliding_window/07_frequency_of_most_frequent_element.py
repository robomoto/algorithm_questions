    Finds the frequency of the most frequent element in an array after performing operations.

    Given an array of integers and a number of allowed operations, the task is to determine the maximum frequency
    of the most frequent element after applying the allowed operations. Each operation can increase an element by 1.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers representing the elements.
        k (int): The number of allowed operations.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum frequency of the most frequent element after the operations.
