    Finds the median of two sorted arrays.

    Given two sorted arrays, the task is to find the median of the two arrays. The median is the middle element 
    when the arrays are combined, or the average of the two middle elements if the total number of elements is even.

    Args:
        nums1 (List[int]): The first sorted array.
        nums2 (List[int]): The second sorted array.

    Returns:
        float: The median of the two sorted arrays.
