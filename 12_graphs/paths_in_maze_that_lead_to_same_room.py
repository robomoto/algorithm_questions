def paths_in_maze_that_lead_to_same_room():
    """
    Finds all the distinct paths in a maze that lead to the same room.

    Given a maze represented by a grid of rooms, the task is to determine all the distinct paths that lead
    to a specific room. Each room is connected by open paths, and the task is to find all possible ways to
    navigate through the maze to reach the target room.

    Args:
        maze (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid representing the maze, where each cell indicates whether the room is accessible.
        start (Tuple[int, int]): The starting room's coordinates.
        target (Tuple[int, int]): The target room's coordinates.

    Returns:
        List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]: A list of distinct paths, each path is a list of room coordinates.
