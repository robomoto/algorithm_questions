def range_module():
    """
    Implements a data structure to track and modify ranges of numbers.

    The Range Module supports adding, removing, and querying ranges efficiently.
    A range is defined as a half-open interval [left, right), where `left` is inclusive
    and `right` is exclusive.

    Methods:
        addRange(left: int, right: int) -> None:
            Adds the range [left, right) to the tracked set of ranges.

        removeRange(left: int, right: int) -> None:
            Removes the range [left, right) from the tracked set of ranges.

        queryRange(left: int, right: int) -> bool:
            Returns True if every number in the range [left, right) is currently tracked.

    Args:
        left (int): The start of the range.
        right (int): The end of the range.

    Returns:
        bool: For queryRange â€” whether the entire range is currently being tracked.
        None: For addRange and removeRange operations.
