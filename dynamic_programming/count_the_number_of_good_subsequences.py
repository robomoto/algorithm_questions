    Counts the number of good subsequences in a given array.

    A subsequence is considered good if it meets certain criteria, such as having all elements
    satisfying a specific condition (e.g., the subsequence may need to contain only even numbers,
    or all elements must be distinct).

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The number of good subsequences in the array.
