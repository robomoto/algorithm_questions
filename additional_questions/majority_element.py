    Finds the majority element in an array.

    Given an array of integers, the task is to find the majority element. The majority element is the element that 
    appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, where n is the length of the array. It is guaranteed that there is a majority 
    element in the array.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array.

    Returns:
        int: The majority element in the array.
