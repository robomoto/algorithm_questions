def word_ladder():
    """
    Finds the shortest transformation sequence from a start word to a target word.

    Given a start word and a target word, the task is to find the length of the shortest transformation sequence 
    from the start word to the target word, where each transformed word must exist in a given word list. 
    Each transformation can change exactly one character, and each intermediate word must be a valid word in the list.

    Args:
        beginWord (str): The starting word.
        endWord (str): The target word.
        wordList (List[str]): A list of valid words.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
