    Determines the minimum time required to visit all points in a 2D plane.

    Given a list of points on a 2D plane, the task is to determine the minimum time required to visit all points.
    The time to move between two points is the Manhattan distance between them. The task is to find the total time
    required to visit all points in the given order.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum time required to visit all points.
