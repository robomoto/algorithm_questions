    Finds the maximum number of points that lie on a single straight line.

    Given a list of points, the task is to determine the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.
    The points are represented as pairs of coordinates (x, y), and the function calculates the maximum number of points
    that are collinear.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of points that lie on a single straight line.
