    Minimizes the number of transactions required to settle debts between a group of people.

    Each transaction is represented as a tuple of (from_person, to_person, amount), indicating
    that one person gave a certain amount of money to another. The goal is to determine the
    minimal number of transactions needed to settle all debts so that everyoneâ€™s net balance is zero.

    Args:
        transactions (List[List[int]]): A list of transactions, where each transaction is a list
        of three integers [from, to, amount].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of transactions required to settle all debts.
