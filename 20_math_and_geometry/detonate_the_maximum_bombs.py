def detonate_the_maximum_bombs():
    """
    Determines the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.

    Given a list of bombs, each represented by a position and a radius, the task is to find the maximum number of bombs
    that can be detonated. When one bomb explodes, it detonates all other bombs that are within its radius.

    Args:
        bombs (List[List[int]]): A list of bombs, where each bomb is represented by a pair of integers [x, y, r],
                                  where (x, y) is the position of the bomb and r is its detonation radius.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.
