    Swaps two nodes in a linked list by their 1-based index.

    Given a linked list and two indices, the task is to swap the nodes at the given indices. The operation

    Args:
        head (ListNode): The head node of the linked list.
        k (int): The 1-based index of the first node to swap.
        m (int): The 1-based index of the second node to swap.

        ListNode: The head node of the modified linked list after swapping the two nodes.
