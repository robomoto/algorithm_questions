def maximum_average_pass_ratio():
    """
    Calculates the maximum average pass ratio after increasing the number of students in a class.

    Given a list of classes, where each class is represented by two numbers: the number of students that passed 
    and the total number of students in the class, the task is to determine the maximum average pass ratio 
    by increasing the number of students in the class with the lowest pass ratio.

    Args:
        classes (List[List[int]]): A list of pairs where each pair represents [passed, total] students in a class.

    Returns:
        float: The maximum possible average pass ratio after optimally increasing the number of students.
