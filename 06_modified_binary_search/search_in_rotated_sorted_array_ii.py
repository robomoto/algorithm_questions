    Searches for a target value in a rotated sorted array with duplicates.

    Given a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, the task is to search for a target value and 
    return its index if it exists, or -1 if the target is not in the array. The array is sorted but rotated at an unknown pivot.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The rotated sorted array, which may contain duplicates.
        target (int): The target value to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target value if it exists, or -1 if the target is not found in the array.
