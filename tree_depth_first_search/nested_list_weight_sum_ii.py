def nested_list_weight_sum_ii():

    Calculates the weighted sum of a nested list of integers, considering depth.

    Given a nested list of integers where each integer can be inside sublists at different depths, the task is to calculate
    the weighted sum, where each element at depth `d` is multiplied by `d`. The depth of the root is considered to be 1.

    Args:
        nestedList (List[NestedInteger]): A list that may contain integers or further nested lists of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The weighted sum of all integers in the nested list, considering their depth.
