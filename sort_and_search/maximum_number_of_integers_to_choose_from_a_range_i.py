    Finds the maximum number of integers that can be chosen from a given range.

    Given a range [1, n] and a set of constraints on how many numbers can be selected, the task is to determine
    the maximum number of integers that can be chosen from the range while satisfying the constraints.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the range of integers [1, n].
        constraints (List[int]): A list of constraints or rules on how many integers can be chosen.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of integers that can be chosen from the given range.
