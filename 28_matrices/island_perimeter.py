def island_perimeter():
    """
    Calculates the perimeter of an island in a grid.

    Given a 2D grid representing a map of water and land, the task is to calculate the perimeter of an island.
    The grid is made up of 1s (representing land) and 0s (representing water). The perimeter is the total length
    of the boundary of the island, which is formed by land cells (1s).

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the grid, where 1s represent land and 0s represent water.

    Returns:
        int: The perimeter of the island.
