def minimize_manhattan_distances():
    """
    Minimizes the total Manhattan distance between two sets of points.

    Given two sets of points on a 2D plane, the task is to determine the minimum total Manhattan distance
    that can be obtained by pairing each point in the first set with a point in the second set.

    The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

    Args:
        points1 (List[List[int]]): The first set of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].
        points2 (List[List[int]]): The second set of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum total Manhattan distance between the two sets of points.
