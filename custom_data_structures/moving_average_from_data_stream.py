def moving_average_from_data_stream():
    """
    Calculates the moving average from a stream of integers with a fixed window size.

    The moving average is the average of the most recent `size` elements in the stream.
    As new values are added, old values are removed to maintain the window size.

    Methods:
        next(val: int) -> float:
            Adds a new integer to the stream and returns the current moving average.

    Args:
        val (int): The new value from the data stream.

    Returns:
        float: The moving average of the last `size` elements.
