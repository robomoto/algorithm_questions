def binary_search():
    """
    Performs binary search to find the index of a target element in a sorted array.

    Given a sorted array and a target element, the task is to find the index of the target element using binary search. 
    Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the target with the middle element, 
    and narrowing the search range based on the comparison.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A sorted list of integers.
        target (int): The element to search for in the list.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target element if found, or -1 if the target element is not in the list.
