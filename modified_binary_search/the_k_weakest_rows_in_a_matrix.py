def the_k_weakest_rows_in_a_matrix():
    """
    Finds the k weakest rows in a matrix.

    Given a matrix of 1s (representing soldiers) and 0s (representing civilians), where each row represents a row of soldiers 
    and civilians, the task is to determine the k weakest rows. A row is considered weaker if it has fewer soldiers (1s), 
    with ties broken by the row index.

    Args:
        mat (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the matrix of soldiers and civilians.
        k (int): The number of weakest rows to return.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix.
