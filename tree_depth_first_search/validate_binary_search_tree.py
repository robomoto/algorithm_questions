    Validates if a given binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).

    Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to determine if the tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). 
    A binary search tree is valid if for every node, the value of the left child is less than the node’s value, 
    and the value of the right child is greater than the node’s value, with the same property recursively holding for all subtrees.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the tree is a valid binary search tree, False otherwise.
