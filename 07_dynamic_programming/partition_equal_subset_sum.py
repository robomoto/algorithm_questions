def partition_equal_subset_sum():
    """
    Determines if a given set of numbers can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.

    The task is to decide whether itâ€™s possible to partition the array into two subsets such that
    the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal. If the total sum of the array is odd, it's
    impossible to partition it into two equal subsets.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum, False otherwise.
