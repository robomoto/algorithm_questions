def rank_teams_by_votes():
    """
    Ranks teams based on their votes.

    Given a list of vote strings, where each string contains a ranked list of teams, the task is to determine
    the overall ranking of the teams. Each character in a vote string represents a team's rank, and the task is to
    compute the total rank for each team based on their position in the votes. The team with the most favorable
    positions (i.e., highest total votes) will be ranked the highest.

    Args:
        votes (List[str]): A list of strings, where each string represents the ranked votes for teams.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of team names, ranked from highest to lowest, based on their total votes.
