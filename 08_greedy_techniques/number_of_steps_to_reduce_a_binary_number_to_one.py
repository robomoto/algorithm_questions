    Calculates the number of steps required to reduce a binary number to 1.

    The task is to perform a series of operations on a binary number to reduce it to 1:
    - If the number is even, divide it by 2.
    - If the number is odd, subtract 1.
    The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps to reach 1.

    Args:
        num (int): The input binary number (as an integer).

    Returns:
        int: The number of steps required to reduce the number to 1.
