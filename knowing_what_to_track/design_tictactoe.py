def design_tictactoe():
    """
    Implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

    The task is to design the game logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play on a 3x3 grid.
    The game allows players to take turns marking X or O on the grid. The game ends when a player gets
    three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the grid is full.

    Methods:
        move(row: int, col: int) -> int:
            Marks the specified cell and checks if the move results in a win or a draw. Returns:
            1 if the current player wins, -1 if the game is a draw, and 0 otherwise.

    Args:
        row (int): The row index where the current player wants to place their mark.
        col (int): The column index where the current player wants to place their mark.

    Returns:
        int: 1 if the current player wins, -1 if the game is a draw, 0 otherwise.
