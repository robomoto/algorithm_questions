    """
    Determines the number of points inside a circle for multiple queries.

    Given a list of points and a set of circle queries, where each query is defined by a center and radius,
    the task is to determine how many points lie inside or on the boundary of the circle for each query.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].
        queries (List[List[int]]): A list of queries, where each query is represented as [center_x, center_y, radius].

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of integers where each integer represents the number of points inside the corresponding circle.
