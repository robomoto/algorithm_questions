    """
    Finds the minimum area of a rectangle that can be formed by a set of points.

    Given a set of points on a 2D plane, the task is to find the smallest possible area of a rectangle that can be
    formed by using four points from the set as the corners of the rectangle. The rectangle must be axis-aligned.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum area of the rectangle that can be formed by the points, or 0 if no rectangle can be formed.
