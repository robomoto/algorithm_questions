def evaluate_division():
    """
    Evaluates the division of equations based on given values.

    Given a list of equations in the form of pairs of variables and a list of queries, the task is to evaluate
    the result of each query based on the provided equations and their corresponding values. Each equation defines
    the division relationship between two variables.

    Args:
        equations (List[List[str]]): A list of equations in the form ["A", "B"], representing A / B.
        values (List[float]): A list of values corresponding to each equation.
        queries (List[List[str]]): A list of queries where each query asks for the value of "A" / "B".

    Returns:
        List[float]: A list of results for each query. If a query cannot be evaluated, return -1.0 for that query.
