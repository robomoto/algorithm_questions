def implement_trie_prefix_tree():
    """
    Implements a trie (prefix tree) data structure.

    A trie is a special type of tree used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings. 
    The trie allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of strings, especially when there are common prefixes.

    The task is to implement the following operations:
    1. `insert(word)`: Inserts a word into the trie.
    2. `search(word)`: Returns true if the word exists in the trie.
    3. `startsWith(prefix)`: Returns true if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.

    Args:
        word (str): The word to insert or search in the trie.
        prefix (str): The prefix to check for in the trie.

    Returns:
        bool: The result of the search or prefix check operation.
