    Finds the k-th smallest pair distance from two sorted arrays.

    Given a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, the task is to find the k-th smallest distance
    between any two numbers in the array. The distance between two numbers is the absolute difference between them.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A sorted list of integers.
        k (int): The index of the smallest pair distance to find.

    Returns:
        int: The k-th smallest pair distance.
