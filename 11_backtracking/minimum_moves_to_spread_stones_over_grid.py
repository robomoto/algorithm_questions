def minimum_moves_to_spread_stones_over_grid():
    """
    Given a 3x3 grid where each cell contains a certain number of stones, determines the
    minimum number of moves required to ensure each cell has exactly one stone.

    In one move, you can move a single stone from one cell to an adjacent cell
    (up, down, left, or right). The goal is to balance the grid so every cell has one stone.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 3x3 list representing the number of stones in each cell.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of moves required to balance the grid.
