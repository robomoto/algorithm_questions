    Calculates the minimum cost to hire k workers.

    Given a list of worker costs and their quality ratings, the task is to hire exactly k workers such that
    the total cost is minimized. The cost of hiring a worker is calculated by multiplying their cost and quality.

        quality (List[int]): A list of integers representing the quality ratings of the workers.
        cost (List[int]): A list of integers representing the costs of the workers.

        int: The minimum total cost to hire k workers.
