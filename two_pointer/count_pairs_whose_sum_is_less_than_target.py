    Counts the number of pairs whose sum is less than a given target.

    Given an array of integers and a target value, the task is to count how many pairs of elements from the array
    have a sum less than the given target value.

        nums (List[int]): A list of integers to find pairs from.
        target (int): The target value to compare the sum of the pairs against.

    Returns:
        int: The number of pairs whose sum is less than the target.
