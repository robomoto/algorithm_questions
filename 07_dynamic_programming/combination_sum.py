def combination_sum():
    """
    Finds all unique combinations of numbers from a list of candidates that sum up to a target.

    Each number in `candidates` can be used an unlimited number of times in the combination.
    The combination must be composed of distinct numbers, and the order of the numbers does not matter.

    Args:
        candidates (List[int]): A list of candidate numbers.
        target (int): The target sum to achieve.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of all unique combinations of candidates that sum to the target.
