    Finds all repeated 10-letter DNA sequences in a string.

    Given a string s representing a DNA sequence, the task is to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) 
    that appear more than once in the string. The sequences should be returned as a list of strings.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string representing the DNA sequence.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of 10-letter-long repeated DNA sequences in the string.
