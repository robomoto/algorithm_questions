    Finds the largest sum of two numbers in an array that is less than a given target.

    Given an array of integers and a target value `k`, the task is to find the largest sum of any two numbers 
    in the array such that their sum is less than `k`. If no such pair exists, return -1.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
        k (int): The target value.

    Returns:
        int: The largest sum of two numbers less than `k`, or -1 if no such pair exists.
