def last_day_where_you_can_still_cross():
    """
    Finds the last day when you can still cross.

    Given a grid representing a body of water and land, where the grid changes each day, the task is to determine 
    the last day when you can cross from one side of the grid to the other. Each day, some water cells become land, 
    and the goal is to find the last day when there exists a path from the left to the right side of the grid.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid where 0 represents water and 1 represents land.
        rows (int): The number of rows in the grid.
        columns (int): The number of columns in the grid.

    Returns:
        int: The last day when you can still cross from the left to the right side of the grid.
