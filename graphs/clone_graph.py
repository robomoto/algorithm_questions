    Clones an undirected graph.

    Given a reference to a graph node, the task is to create a deep copy of the graph. Each node in the graph
    contains a value and a list of its neighbors. The cloned graph should have the same structure as the original.

    Args:
        node (Node): The reference to the original graph's node.

    Returns:
        Node: The reference to the root node of the cloned graph.
