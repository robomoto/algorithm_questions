    Finds the maximum number of envelopes that can be Russian-dolled.

    Given a set of envelopes with width and height, the task is to determine the maximum number of envelopes
    that can be nested inside one another. An envelope can be nested inside another if both its width and height
    are smaller than the other envelope.

    Args:
        envelopes (List[List[int]]): A list of envelopes, where each envelope is represented as [width, height].

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside one another.
