def minimum_number_of_k_consecutive_bit_flips():
    """
    Finds the minimum number of K-bit flips required to make all elements in a binary array 1.

    In one flip, you can choose any subarray of length `k` and flip every bit in that subarray
    (i.e., change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0). If it is not possible to make all elements 1, return -1.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of binary digits (0s and 1s).
        k (int): The fixed length of each flip operation.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of flips required, or -1 if it is not possible.
