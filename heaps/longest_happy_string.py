    characters that are the same.

    Args:
        a (int): The number of occurrences of character 'a'.
        b (int): The number of occurrences of character 'b'.
        c (int): The number of occurrences of character 'c'.

    Returns:
        str: The longest happy string that can be formed, or an empty string if no valid string can be created.
