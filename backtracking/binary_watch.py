def binary_watch():
    """
    Finds all possible times a binary watch could represent.

    Given a non-negative integer `turnedOn` representing the number of LEDs that are currently on, the task is to 
    return all possible times the binary watch could represent. The binary watch has 4 LEDs for the hours (0–11) 
    and 6 LEDs for the minutes (0–59). Each LED represents a binary digit.

    Args:
        turnedOn (int): Number of LEDs that are turned on.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of strings representing all possible valid times in "H:MM" format.
