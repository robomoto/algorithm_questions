def container_with_most_water():
    """
    Finds the container that can hold the most water.

    Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of lines on a coordinate plane, the task is to 
    find the maximum area of water that can be trapped between two lines. The area is determined by the shorter of 
    the two lines and the horizontal distance between them.

    Args:
        height (List[int]): A list of integers representing the heights of the lines.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum area of water that can be trapped between two lines.
