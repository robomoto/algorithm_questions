def subtree_of_another_tree():
    """
    Checks if one tree is a subtree of another tree.

    Given the roots of two binary trees, the task is to determine if one tree is a subtree of the other. A tree is a subtree 
    if it is a part of the other tree, with the same structure and node values.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the main binary tree.
        subRoot (TreeNode): The root node of the subtree.

    Returns:
        bool: True if subRoot is a subtree of root, False otherwise.
