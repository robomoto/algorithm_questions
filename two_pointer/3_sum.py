    Finds all unique triplets in an array that sum up to a target value.

    Given an array of integers, the task is to find all unique triplets in the array whose sum is equal to zero.
    The solution should not include duplicate triplets in the result.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers to find the triplets from.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers that sum to zero.
