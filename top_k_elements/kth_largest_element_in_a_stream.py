    """
    Finds the k-th largest element in a stream of numbers.

    Given a stream of integers, the task is to maintain the k-th largest element in the stream efficiently as new numbers
    are continuously added. The function should return the k-th largest element after each insertion.

    Args:
        num (int): A new number to insert into the stream.
        k (int): The index (1-based) of the largest element to find.
        stream (List[int]): A list representing the stream of numbers so far.

    Returns:
        int: The k-th largest element in the current stream.
