    Counts the number of valid pairs between two arrays.

    Given two arrays, the task is to count the number of pairs such that each pair consists of one element from each array 
    and satisfies a specific condition, such as a comparison of their values.

    Args:
        arr1 (List[int]): The first list of integers.
        arr2 (List[int]): The second list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The number of valid pairs between the two arrays.
