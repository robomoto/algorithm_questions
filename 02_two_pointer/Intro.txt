Clues to use Two-Pointer:
When working with Arrays or lists
* Given a sorted array, or allowed to sort it
* You're looking for pairs, or ranges with specific properties(sum, difference, duplicates, etc)

Examples:
* Find if there exists a pair that sums to a target.
* Find closest pair / smallest window / bounded difference
* Remove duplicates in-place

When the question involves subarrays, substrings, or windows where you are scanning contiguous elements and may need to adjust start/end dynamically
* Often combined with sliding-window techniques

Examples:
Longest substring without repeating characters
Minimum window substring
Maximum average subarray of length k

Symmetry or Palindromes
* If you need to compare from both ends and move toward the center. 
Note: Some Palindrome questions need to start at the center of a substring and work out--those typically aren't good two-pointer questions.

Examples:
* Valid palindrome
* Valid palindrome with at most one deletion
* Check if a string can be a palindrome permutation

Merging or comparing two sorted lists:
* If you're merging or processing two arrays in sync
Examples:
* Merge two sorted arrays
* Find the intersection of two arrays
* Sorted squares of a sorted array

Min/Max in range or distance between elements
* If you're asked to find the longest, shortest, closest range, distance or segment and it's not a graph--you might be looking at a two-pointer problem.

Examples:
* Find the smallest range covering elements from k lists
* Container with most water
* Trapping rain water (a clever variant)


Quiz:

Q: Container With Most Water
You are given an array of heights representing vertical lines. Find two lines that together form a container with the most water.
Should you use two pointers?


Q: Merge Two Sorted Arrays In-Place
You are given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, and you need to merge them into one sorted array in-place in nums1.
Should you use two pointers?


Q: First Unique Character in a String
Return the index of the first non-repeating character in a string. If thereâ€™s none, return -1.

Q: Are Two Strings Anagrams?
Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., same letters, same frequency).
