def number_of_provinces():
    """
    Finds the number of provinces in a graph.

    Given a 2D matrix where each element represents the connection between two nodes in an undirected graph, 
    the task is to determine the number of provinces. A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected nodes, 
    and the task is to find how many such groups exist in the graph.

    Args:
        isConnected (List[List[int]]): A 2D matrix representing the graph, where isConnected[i][j] = 1 means node i 
                                       is connected to node j, and 0 means no connection.

    Returns:
        int: The number of provinces in the graph.
