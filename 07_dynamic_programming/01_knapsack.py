def zero_one_knapsack():
    """
    Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

    Given weights and values of `n` items, and a maximum weight capacity `W`, determine the
    maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items such that their total weight does not
    exceed `W`. Each item can be included at most once.

    Args:
        weights (List[int]): A list of weights for each item.
        values (List[int]): A list of values for each item.
        W (int): The maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum total value achievable within the given weight capacity.
