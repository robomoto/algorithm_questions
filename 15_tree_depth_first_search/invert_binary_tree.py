    Inverts a binary tree.

    Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to invert the tree. This means that for each node in the tree, 
    its left and right children are swapped.

        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        TreeNode: The root node of the inverted binary tree.
