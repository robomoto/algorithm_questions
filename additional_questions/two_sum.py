def two_sum():
    """
    Finds two numbers in an array that add up to a given target.

    Given an array of integers and a target value, the task is to find two distinct numbers in the array that sum up to 
    the given target. Each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
        target (int): The target sum to find in the array.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target sum.
