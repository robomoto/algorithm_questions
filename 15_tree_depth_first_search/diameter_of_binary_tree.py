def diameter_of_binary_tree():

    Finds the diameter of a binary tree.

    The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
    This path may or may not pass through the root. The length of the path is measured by the number of edges between the nodes.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.

    Returns:
        int: The diameter of the binary tree, which is the length of the longest path between two nodes.
