    Checks if two binary trees are identical.

    Given the roots of two binary trees, the task is to determine if the trees are identical. Two binary trees are
    considered identical if they have the same structure and their corresponding nodes have the same value.

    Args:
        root1 (TreeNode): The root node of the first binary tree.
        root2 (TreeNode): The root node of the second binary tree.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the two trees are identical, False otherwise.
