def minimum_window_substring():
    """
    Finds the minimum window substring that contains all characters of a target string.

    Given two strings s and t, the task is to find the minimum window substring in s that contains all the characters 
    of t. The characters in the window must include all characters from t, with their frequency matched exactly, 
    and the substring should be the shortest possible.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to search within.
        t (str): The target string containing the characters that must be included in the window.

    Returns:
        str: The minimum window substring in s that contains all characters of t, or an empty string if no such window exists.
