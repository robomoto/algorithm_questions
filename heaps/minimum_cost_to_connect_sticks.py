    Calculates the minimum cost to connect all sticks.

    You are given a list of sticks, and you need to connect them into one piece. Each time you connect two sticks, 
    the cost is the sum of their lengths. The task is to determine the minimum cost to connect all the sticks into 
    one piece.

    Args:
        sticks (List[int]): A list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum cost to connect all the sticks.
