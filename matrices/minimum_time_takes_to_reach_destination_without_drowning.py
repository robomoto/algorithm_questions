def minimum_time_takes_to_reach_destination_without_drowning():
    """
    Determines the minimum time to reach the destination without drowning.

    Given a grid where each cell represents a part of a body of water with varying depths, the task is to determine 
    the minimum time required to travel from a starting point to a destination, while avoiding any cells that are too deep
    (representing areas where the player would drown). The time it takes to travel through each cell is proportional to the 
    depth of the cell.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the grid, where each element represents the depth of the water at that cell.
        start (List[int]): The coordinates of the starting point [x, y].
        destination (List[int]): The coordinates of the destination point [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum time required to reach the destination, or -1 if it's not possible to reach the destination without drowning.
