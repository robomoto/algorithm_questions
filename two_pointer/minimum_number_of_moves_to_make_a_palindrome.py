    Minimum Number of Moves to Make a Palindrome
    Given a string s, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
    Choose any two characters in s and swap them.
    Return the minimum number of moves to make s a palindrome.
    A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
    A string is a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse.
    A string is a subsequence of a string if it can be derived from the string by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
    A string is a subsequence of itself.
