    Finds the maximum twin sum of a linked list.

    The twin sum of a linked list is defined as the sum of a pair of elements at symmetric positions
    in the list (i.e., the first and the last, the second and the second last, etc.). The task is to
    find the maximum twin sum of any pair in the linked list.

    Args:
        head (ListNode): The head node of the linked list.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum twin sum of the linked list.
