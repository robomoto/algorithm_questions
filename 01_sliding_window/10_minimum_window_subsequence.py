def minimum_window_subsequence():
    """
    Finds the minimum window in string s that contains a subsequence from string t.

    Given two strings s and t, the task is to find the minimum window in string s that contains all characters of string t as a subsequence. 
    The characters in the window must appear in the same order as they appear in t, but not necessarily consecutively.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string from which the window is to be found.
        t (str): The target subsequence string.

    Returns:
        str: The minimum window subsequence in s, or an empty string if no such window exists.
