    Determines if it's possible to plant flowers in a flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

    You have a flowerbed represented as an array where 0 means an empty spot and 1 means a planted flower. 
    The task is to determine if it's possible to plant `n` flowers in the flowerbed such that no two flowers 
    are adjacent to each other.

    Args:
        flowerbed (List[int]): A list representing the flowerbed, where 0 is an empty spot and 1 is a flower.
        n (int): The number of flowers to plant.

    Returns:
        bool: True if it's possible to plant `n` flowers, otherwise False.
