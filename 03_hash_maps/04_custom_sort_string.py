    Sorts a string based on the order of characters in another string.

    Given two strings `S` and `T`, the task is to sort string `T` such that the characters appear in the order
    defined by string `S`. Any characters in `T` that are not in `S` should appear in the order they were originally
    in `T`.

    Args:
        S (str): A string representing the custom order of characters.
        T (str): A string to be sorted according to the custom order defined by `S`.

    Returns:
        str: The sorted string `T` based on the custom order defined by `S`.
