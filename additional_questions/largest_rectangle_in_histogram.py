def largest_rectangle_in_histogram():
    """
    Finds the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram.

    Given a list of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, the task is to find the area of the 
    largest rectangle that can be formed using the bars. The width of the rectangle is determined by the distance 
    between the bars, and the height is determined by the shortest bar in the rectangle.

    Args:
        heights (List[int]): A list of integers representing the heights of the histogram bars.

    Returns:
        int: The area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in the histogram.
