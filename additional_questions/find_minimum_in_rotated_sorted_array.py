    Finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.

    Given a rotated sorted array, the task is to find the minimum element in the array. The array was originally sorted 
    in ascending order, but it was rotated at an unknown pivot. The rotation may cause the minimum element to not be at 
    the beginning of the array.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A rotated sorted array of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum element in the rotated sorted array.
