    """
    Reorders the routes in a graph so that all paths lead to city 0.

    Given a list of routes between cities, the task is to reorder the routes such that all paths lead to city 0.
    Each route connects two cities, and the graph is directed. The goal is to reorder the routes so that city 0 
    is reachable from every other city in the graph.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cities.
        routes (List[List[int]]): A list of directed routes between cities, where each route is a pair of cities [from, to].

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: The reordered list of routes such that all paths lead to city 0.
