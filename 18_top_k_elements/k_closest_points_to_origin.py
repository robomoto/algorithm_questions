def k_closest_points_to_origin():
    """
    Finds the k closest points to the origin in a 2D plane.

    Given a list of points in a 2D plane, the task is to find the k points that are closest to the origin (0, 0).
    The distance between two points is the Euclidean distance, which can be calculated as the square root of the sum
    of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].
        k (int): The number of closest points to return.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of the k closest points to the origin.
