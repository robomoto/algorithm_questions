def redundant_connection():
    """
    Finds the redundant connection in an undirected graph.

    Given a set of edges in an undirected graph, the task is to identify the redundant connection that, when removed,
    will make the graph a tree. A graph is a tree if it is connected and acyclic, and removing one edge will make it 
    disconnected.

    Args:
        edges (List[List[int]]): A list of edges where each edge is represented as a pair [u, v] indicating an edge 
                                  between nodes u and v.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list representing the redundant edge [u, v] that, if removed, will result in a valid tree.
