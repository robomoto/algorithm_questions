    Finds the minimum number of straight lines required to cover a given set of points.

    Given a set of points in a 2D plane, the task is to determine the minimum number of straight lines needed 
    to cover all the points, where each line can contain multiple points if they lie on the same line.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of straight lines required to cover all points.
