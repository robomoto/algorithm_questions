    Generates all possible subsets of a given set of elements.

    Given a list of integers, the task is to generate all possible subsets of the list. This includes the empty set

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers to generate subsets from.

        List[List[int]]: A list of all possible subsets of the input list.
