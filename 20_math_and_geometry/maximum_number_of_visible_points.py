    """
    Finds the maximum number of visible points from a given viewpoint.

    Given a set of points on a 2D plane and a viewpoint, the task is to find the maximum number of points that 
    are visible from the viewpoint. A point is considered visible if it is not blocked by another point and is within 
    the given angular range from the viewpoint.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].
        angle (int): The angular range within which points are visible from the viewpoint.
        location (List[int]): The coordinates of the viewpoint, represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of visible points from the viewpoint.
