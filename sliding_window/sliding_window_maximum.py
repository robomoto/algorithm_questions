def sliding_window_maximum():
    """
    Finds the maximum value in each sliding window of size k in an array.

    Given an array of integers and a window size k, the task is to find the maximum value in each sliding window 
    of size k. The window slides from left to right across the array, and at each step, the maximum value in the 
    current window should be recorded.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array.
        k (int): The size of the sliding window.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of the maximum values for each sliding window.
