    Deletes N nodes after every M nodes in a linked list.

    Given a linked list, the task is to delete N nodes after every M nodes in the list. The function should
    keep the first M nodes intact and then delete the next N nodes, repeating this process until the end of the list.

    Args:
        head (ListNode): The head node of the linked list.
        M (int): The number of nodes to keep before deleting the next N nodes.
        N (int): The number of nodes to delete after each group of M nodes.

    Returns:
        ListNode: The modified linked list after the deletions.
