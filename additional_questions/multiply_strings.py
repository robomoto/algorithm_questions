    Multiplies two numbers represented as strings.

    Given two non-negative integers represented as strings, the task is to multiply these two numbers and return 
    the result as a string. The multiplication should be done without converting the strings to integers directly.

    Args:
        num1 (str): The first number as a string.
        num2 (str): The second number as a string.

    Returns:
        str: The result of the multiplication as a string.
