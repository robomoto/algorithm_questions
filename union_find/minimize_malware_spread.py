    Youâ€™re given a graph represented as an adjacency matrix graph[i][j] == 1 if node i is connected to node j, and an array initial of infected nodes.

    Malware spreads from infected nodes to all directly connected nodes (recursively).

    You can remove one node from the initial list.
    Your goal: minimize the final number of infected nodes.

    Return the index of the node to remove. If multiple answers are possible, return the smallest index.
