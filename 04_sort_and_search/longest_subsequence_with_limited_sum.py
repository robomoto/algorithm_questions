def longest_subsequence_with_limited_sum():
    """
    Finds the longest subsequence with a sum less than or equal to a given limit.

    Given an array of integers and a limit, the task is to find the longest subsequence of the array where 
    the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the given limit. The subsequence can be formed by picking 
    elements in order, but not necessarily consecutively.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The list of integers to form the subsequence from.
        limit (int): The maximum sum that the subsequence can have.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest subsequence that meets the sum constraint.
