    Args:
        dictionary (List[str]): A list of valid prefix strings.
        sentence (str): A string sentence where each word may be replaced by a prefix from the dictionary.

    Returns:
        str: The sentence with each word replaced by its shortest prefix, or the word itself if no prefix is found.
