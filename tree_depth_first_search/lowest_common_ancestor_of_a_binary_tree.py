def lowest_common_ancestor_of_a_binary_tree():
    """
    Finds the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.

    Given the root of a binary tree and two nodes, the task is to find the lowest common ancestor of the two nodes.
    The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a binary tree is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both p and q.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.
        p (TreeNode): The first node for which to find the LCA.
        q (TreeNode): The second node for which to find the LCA.

    Returns:
        TreeNode: The lowest common ancestor of the two nodes, or None if no ancestor exists.
