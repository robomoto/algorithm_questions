def rotting_oranges():
    """
    Determines the minimum time required for all oranges to rot.

    Given a grid representing a collection of oranges, where 1 represents a fresh orange, 2 represents a rotten orange, 
    and 0 represents an empty cell, the task is to determine the minimum time required for all fresh oranges to rot. 
    Each minute, all adjacent fresh oranges to a rotten orange become rotten. If some fresh oranges cannot rot, return -1.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid representing the state of the oranges.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of minutes required for all oranges to rot, or -1 if not all fresh oranges can rot.
