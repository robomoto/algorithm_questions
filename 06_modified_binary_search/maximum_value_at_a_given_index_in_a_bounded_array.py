def maximum_value_at_a_given_index_in_a_bounded_array():
    """
    Finds the maximum value at a given index in a bounded array.

    Given a bounded array with a maximum value at a specific index, the task is to compute the maximum value at that index 
    based on the sum of the elements in the array. The array follows certain constraints, such as the sum of all elements being bounded.

    Args:
        n (int): The size of the array.
        index (int): The specific index where the value needs to be computed.
        maxSum (int): The maximum sum of the elements in the array.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum value at the given index based on the constraints.
