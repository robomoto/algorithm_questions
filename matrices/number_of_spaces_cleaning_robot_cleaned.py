def number_of_spaces_cleaning_robot_cleaned():
    """
    Calculates the number of spaces cleaned by a robot.

    Given a grid representing a room and the movements of a robot, the task is to determine the number of distinct spaces
    that the robot has cleaned. The robot starts at a given position and can move in specific directions. The grid is 
    marked with cleaned and uncleaned spaces.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the room, where 1 represents a cleaned space and 0 represents an uncleaned space.
        start (List[int]): The starting position of the robot in the grid [x, y].
        movements (List[str]): A list of movements (e.g., "up", "down", "left", "right") that the robot makes.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct spaces that the robot has cleaned.
