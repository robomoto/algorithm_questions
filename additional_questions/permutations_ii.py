    Generates all unique permutations of a list of numbers, including duplicates.

    Given a list of numbers, the task is to return all possible unique permutations of the list. The list may contain 
    duplicate numbers, so the solution should ensure that duplicate permutations are not included in the result.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers that may contain duplicates.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of all unique permutations of the input list.
