    Calculates the sum of two integers without using the + operator.

    Given two integers, the task is to compute their sum without using the addition operator (+). The sum should be 
    calculated using bitwise operations.

        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the two integers.
