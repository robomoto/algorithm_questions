    Counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number from 0 to `n`.

    Given an integer `n`, the function returns a list where each index `i` contains the number of 1's
    in the binary representation of `i`.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit for the range of numbers (inclusive).

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list where each element represents the count of 1's in the binary representation
        of the corresponding index.
