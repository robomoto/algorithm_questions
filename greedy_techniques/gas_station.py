def gas_station():
    """
    Determines if there is a valid starting gas station for a circular route.

    You are given an array of gas amounts and an array of distances between stations. The task is to determine
    if there exists a gas station from which you can travel around the circular route without running out of gas. 
    You start with a full tank and the goal is to complete the circuit.

    Args:
        gas (List[int]): A list representing the amount of gas at each station.
        cost (List[int]): A list representing the cost of gas to travel to the next station.

    Returns:
        int: The starting gas station index from which you can travel around the circle, or -1 if it's impossible.
