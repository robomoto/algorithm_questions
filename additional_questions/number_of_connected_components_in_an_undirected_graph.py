    Finds the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

    Given an undirected graph, the task is to determine the number of connected components in the graph. 
    A connected component is a set of nodes in which there is a path between any two nodes in the component.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of nodes in the graph.
        edges (List[List[int]]): A list of edges, where each edge is a pair of nodes representing an undirected edge.

    Returns:
        int: The number of connected components in the graph.
