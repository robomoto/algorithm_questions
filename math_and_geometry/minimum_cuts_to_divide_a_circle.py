    Finds the minimum number of straight cuts required to divide a circle into a given number of regions.

    Given an integer `n`, the task is to determine the minimum number of straight cuts required to divide a circle 
    into `n` regions. The cuts must be straight lines that can intersect each other, but no cuts should be parallel.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of regions to divide the circle into.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of cuts required to divide the circle into `n` regions.
