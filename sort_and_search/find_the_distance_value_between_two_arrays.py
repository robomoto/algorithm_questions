    Finds the distance value between two arrays.

    Given two arrays, the task is to determine the number of elements in the first array that have a distance 
    greater than a given threshold from every element in the second array. The distance between two elements is 
    defined as the absolute difference between them.

    Args:
        arr1 (List[int]): The first list of integers.
        arr2 (List[int]): The second list of integers.
        d (int): The threshold distance value.

    Returns:
        int: The number of elements in the first array that have a distance greater than d from every element in the second array.
