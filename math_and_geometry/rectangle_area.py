def rectangle_area():
    """
    Calculates the area of a rectangle.

    Given the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners of a rectangle, the task is to calculate
    its area. The area of a rectangle is determined by the formula: width * height, where width is the 
    horizontal distance between the left and right sides, and height is the vertical distance between the top and bottom sides.

    Args:
        rect1 (List[int]): A list of four integers representing the bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the first rectangle.
                            [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the bottom-left corner and (x2, y2) is the top-right corner.
        rect2 (List[int]): A list of four integers representing the bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the second rectangle.
                            [x3, y3, x4, y4], where (x3, y3) is the bottom-left corner and (x4, y4) is the top-right corner.

    Returns:
        int: The total area covered by the two rectangles.
