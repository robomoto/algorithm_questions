def flood_fill():
    """
    Performs a "flood fill" on a 2D image starting from the given pixel, changing the color of the
    starting pixel and all connected pixels with the same original color to the new color.

    A pixel is considered connected if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) and has the
    same original color as the starting pixel.

    Args:
        image (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the image, where each value is a pixel color.
        sr (int): Starting pixel row.
        sc (int): Starting pixel column.
        color (int): The new color to apply to the connected area.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: The updated image after performing the flood fill.
