def sum_of_mutated_array_closest_to_target():
    """
    Finds the sum of a mutated array closest to a target.

    Given an array and a target value, the task is to mutate each element of the array by adding or subtracting a certain 
    value, and then find the sum of the mutated array that is closest to the target. The mutation should be done in such 
    a way that the sum of the array gets as close as possible to the target.

    Args:
        arr (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array.
        target (int): The target sum we are trying to approach with the mutated array.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the mutated array that is closest to the target.
