def delete_nodes_and_return_forest():
    """
    Deletes nodes in a binary tree and returns the remaining forest.

    Given the root of a binary tree and a list of nodes to delete, the task is to delete all the specified nodes
    and return the remaining forest (a list of the roots of the remaining trees). A node is deleted if it is in the list of nodes
    to delete, and any children of the deleted node become roots of new trees.

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary tree.
        to_delete (List[int]): A list of node values to delete.

    Returns:
        List[TreeNode]: A list of roots of the remaining trees in the forest after deletion.
