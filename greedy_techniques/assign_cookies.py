    Assigns cookies to children to maximize the number of children who are content.

    Given an array of children's greed factors and an array of cookie sizes, the task is to assign cookies to
    children such that each child gets at most one cookie. A child is content if their greed factor is less than or
    equal to the size of the cookie they receive. The goal is to maximize the number of content children.

    Args:
        g (List[int]): A list representing the greed factors of the children.
        s (List[int]): A list representing the sizes of the cookies.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of content children.
