    Finds the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed with given point constraints.

    Given a set of points on a 2D plane, the task is to find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed
    using these points as the vertices of the rectangle. The rectangle must be aligned with the x and y axes.

    Args:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].

    Returns:
        int: The maximum area of the rectangle that can be formed using the given points.
