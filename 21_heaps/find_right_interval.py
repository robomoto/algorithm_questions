    """
    Finds the right interval for each interval in a list of intervals.

    Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented by a pair of integers [start, end], the task 
    is to find for each interval, the index of the smallest interval that starts at or after the end of the current interval.
    If no such interval exists, return -1 for that interval.

    Args:
        intervals (List[List[int]]): A list of intervals, where each interval is represented as [start, end].

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list where each element is the index of the right interval for the corresponding input interval.
