def happy_number():
    """
    Determines if a number is a "happy number".

    A happy number is defined by the following process:
      - Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
      - Repeat the process until the number becomes 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle
        that does not include 1.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is a happy number, False otherwise.
