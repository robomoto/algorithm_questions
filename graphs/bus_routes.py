    Finds the minimum number of bus routes needed to travel from a source bus stop to a target bus stop.

    You are given a list of bus routes, where each route is a list of bus stops that it passes through.
    You need to find the shortest sequence of bus routes that would allow you to travel from the source to the target.

    Args:
        routes (List[List[int]]): A list of bus routes, where each route is a list of bus stops.
        source (int): The source bus stop.
        target (int): The target bus stop.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of bus routes required, or -1 if no such route exists.
