def insert_delete_getrandom_o1():
    """
    Implements a data structure that supports insert, delete, and getRandom operations in average O(1) time.

    Supports the following operations:
      - insert(val): Inserts an item val if not already present.
      - remove(val): Removes an item val if present.
      - getRandom(): Returns a random element from the current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

    Methods:
        insert(val: int) -> bool
        remove(val: int) -> bool
        getRandom() -> int

    Args:
        val (int): The value to insert or remove.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the operation was successful (for insert and remove).
        int: A random element from the set (for getRandom).
