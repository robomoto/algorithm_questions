    Solves the skyline problem.

    Given a list of buildings, where each building is represented by a triplet [left, right, height], the task is to 
    find the outline of the buildings when viewed from the side. The outline is a series of horizontal segments 
    that represent the upper contour of the buildings, and should account for overlapping buildings.

    Args:
        buildings (List[List[int]]): A list of buildings, where each building is represented by [left, right, height].

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of segments representing the skyline, where each segment is represented as [x, height].
