    Calculates the maximal score after applying k operations.

    Given an array of integers, the task is to calculate the maximal score that can be achieved 
    by applying k operations. Each operation modifies the array in a specific way, and the goal is to maximize 
    the score after exactly k operations.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The list of integers.
        k (int): The number of operations to apply.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum score achievable after k operations.
