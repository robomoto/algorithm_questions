    Finds the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array.

    Given an unsorted array of integers, the task is to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence. 
    The sequence must consist of consecutive integers, and the array may contain duplicates.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest consecutive sequence in the array.
