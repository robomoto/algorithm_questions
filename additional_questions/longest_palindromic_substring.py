    Finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

    Given a string, the task is to find the longest contiguous substring that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase,
    or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

    Args:

    Returns:
        str: The longest palindromic substring in the given string.
