def employee_free_time():
    """
    Finds the free time intervals when no employees are working.

    Given a list of schedules representing the working hours of multiple employees, the task is to find the intervals of free time
    when no employee is working. Each schedule is represented as a list of intervals where each interval consists of a start and end time.

    Args:
        schedules (List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]): A list of employee schedules, where each schedule is a list of tuples representing
                                                 the working hours of that employee.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[int, int]]: A list of intervals where no employees are working, represented as tuples of start and end times.
