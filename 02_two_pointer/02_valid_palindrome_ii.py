    Checks if a string can be a palindrome after removing at most one character.

    Given a string, the task is to determine if it can become a valid palindrome by removing at most one character.
    A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string can become a palindrome after removing at most one character, False otherwise.
