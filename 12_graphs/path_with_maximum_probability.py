def path_with_maximum_probability():
    """
    Finds the path with the maximum probability of success in a graph.

    Given a graph with edges having associated probabilities, the task is to find the path from a start node to an end node
    such that the product of the probabilities along the path is maximized. The graph is represented as a list of edges,
    where each edge connects two nodes with a given probability.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of nodes in the graph.
        edges (List[List[int]]): A list of edges, where each edge is represented as [u, v, probability] 
                                 indicating an edge from node u to node v with a given probability.
        start (int): The start node.
        end (int): The end node.

    Returns:
        float: The maximum probability of reaching the end node from the start node.
