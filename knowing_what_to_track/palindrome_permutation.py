def palindrome_permutation():
    """
    Determines if a given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

    A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. The task is to determine
    if the characters of the given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome. A string can be rearranged into
    a palindrome if, at most, one character has an odd count.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome, False otherwise.
