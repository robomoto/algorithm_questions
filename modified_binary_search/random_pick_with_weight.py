def random_pick_with_weight():

    Randomly picks an index from an array based on weights.

    Given an array of weights, the task is to randomly pick an index from the array such that the probability of
    picking each index is proportional to its weight. The function should return an index from the array with 
    the probability determined by its corresponding weight.

    Args:
        w (List[int]): A list of integers representing the weights of the indices.

    Returns:
        int: A randomly chosen index based on the weight distribution.
