def minimize_malware_spread():
    """
    Minimizes the spread of malware in a network.

    Given a network represented as an undirected graph where nodes are computers and edges represent direct 
    communication links between them, and a list of initially infected nodes, the task is to determine the node 
    to remove to minimize the number of infected computers in the network. After removing that node, the malware 
    can only spread among the remaining nodes.

    Args:
        graph (List[List[int]]): An adjacency matrix representing the undirected graph, where graph[i][j] = 1 
                                  indicates a direct link between nodes i and j, and 0 indicates no direct link.
        infected (List[int]): A list of initially infected nodes.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the node to remove in order to minimize malware spread. If there are multiple valid nodes,
             return the node with the smallest index.
